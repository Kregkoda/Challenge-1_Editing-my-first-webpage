# Challenge-1_Editing-my-first-webpage

This first project is a focus on code refactoring which will help the users ultilizing the website to have a more friendly experience. By implementing accessibilty to the code, it will offer users with a streamlined experience when navigating through the website. In this challenge I was able to structure to the HTML elements to follow a logical structure, add in alt attritubes to images within the code, organize heading attributes so they are in sequential order, and create a clear and concise title for the application.
